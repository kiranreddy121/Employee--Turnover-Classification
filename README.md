Employee turnover refers to the percentage of workers who leave an organization and are replaced by new employees

In this project, weâ€™ll work on HR data to build a classifier that helps us predict what kind of employees will be more likely to leave given some attributes. 

Such classifier would help an organization predict employee turnover and be pro-active in helping to solve such costly matter.
